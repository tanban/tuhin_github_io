				<h2 class="head2">Early Life</h2>
				<p class="para" id="tuhin"><img src="me1.jpg" style=" margin:0 0 10px 10px; float:right" alt="here we go">I was born on the first of May, 1997 at Ghatal in West Bengal. Having born in a middle class family ,I had a free and enjoyable childhood with my
				parents and obviously friends. Little study and a lot of play fill the valuable memories of my early life. Truly speaking, I can never forget those golden days.<br><br>
					
					My friends,who are always beside me have helped me a lot through thick
					and thin.Keeping in touch with all of them is a tough task but I do try it.My life,like the others',has definitely not been a bed 
					of roses.I have been through many highs and lows ,thick and thin.In secondary exmination I ended up securing the last position in the school.
					But our Headmaster Arijit Maharaj taught me the moto of life- "Arise, Awake and stop not still the goal is reached". 
					These words of Swami Vivekananda made me what and where I am now.
					The experiences I have gathered 
					will help me avoid making the same mistakes further.<br><br>
